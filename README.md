# _healthBot, a healthcare chatbot_

### Project Description
A chatbot created in Python with multiple features to aid a user or patient within the health industy. Please note, this project is not finished as it was created as part of my AI module during my undergraduate study. Rule-based commands is a very simple AI technique where given a explicit question, its associated answer is returned. A few health related questions have been implemented but more can be added easily. Another feature, a similarity question-answer pair using bag of words has been included so when a user asks a question, the return will be the answer that corresponds to the question that is most similar to that the user inputted. A simple CNN model has been added to identify the blood cell type given an image. An attempt was made to integrate the NHS API so that the user can call information about a health condition from the NHS website (partly works, too much noise in the output). Additional features are included in the chatbot. Please refer to the report for a more detailed analysis.
